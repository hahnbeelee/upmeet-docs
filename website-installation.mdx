Installing UpMeet to your website is easy! Simply create a new page or use an
existing one and copy the code below and fill in your meeting room id.

```html
<iframe src="https://upmeet.me/meet/?id=_YOUR_ID_" width="100%" height="100vh">
```

This will fill the entire page with your meeting room. However if you would
rather install it differently (e.g. a page with your presentation or nav bar)
you can easily change the code to add it. Just change the width and height to
your desired choice.
